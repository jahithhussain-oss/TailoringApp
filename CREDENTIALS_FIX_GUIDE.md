# Fix: "Google sheet credentials is not found at Google_Sheet_tailor.json"

## 🚨 **Issue**
You're getting this error even after the mobile assets fix because the app needs to be properly cleaned and rebuilt after adding assets.

## ✅ **Solution Steps**

### 1. **Clean the Project**
```bash
cd tailoringapp
flutter clean
```

### 2. **Get Dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. **Verify Assets Configuration**
Check that `pubspec.yaml` contains:
```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/Google_Sheet_tailor.json
```

### 4. **Test Assets Loading (Optional)**
```bash
dart test_assets.dart
```
Should show: "✅ Assets loaded successfully"

### 5. **Build APK**
```bash
# For debug
flutter build apk --debug

# For release
flutter build apk --release
```

### 6. **Install APK**
```bash
flutter install
```

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

When you add assets to a Flutter project, you must:
1. ✅ Add assets to `pubspec.yaml`
2. ✅ Run `flutter clean` (removes old build cache)
3. ✅ Run `flutter pub get` (regenerates build files)
4. ✅ Build new APK (includes assets in bundle)

**Without these steps, the old APK doesn't include the assets!**

## 📱 **Expected Result After Fix**

### **Console Logs Should Show:**
```
Initializing Google Sheets service...
Credentials path: Google_Sheet_tailor.json
Spreadsheet ID: 1F5eBqi23l7O1PohWzeolFZOgOrsZ9wLBBfT9OvqMaWs
✅ Credentials loaded from assets successfully
GSheets instance created
Spreadsheet accessed: 1F5eBqi23l7O1PohWzeolFZOgOrsZ9wLBBfT9OvqMaWs
Google Sheets service initialized successfully
```

### **App Should Show:**
- ✅ Green "Google Sheets connected successfully" message
- ✅ Sync functionality works without errors

## 🚫 **If Still Getting Errors**

### **Check These:**

1. **Assets File Exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la assets/Google_Sheet_tailor.json
   ```

2. **Pubspec.yaml Correct:**
   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - assets/Google_Sheet_tailor.json
   ```

3. **Clean Build:**
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --debug
   ```

4. **Fresh Install:**
   ```bash
   flutter install
   ```

### **Debug Steps:**

1. **Run test script:**
   ```bash
   dart test_assets.dart
   ```

2. **Check console logs** for asset loading messages

3. **Verify APK includes assets:**
   - Unzip APK and check for assets folder
   - Or use Android Studio to inspect APK

## 📋 **Quick Fix Checklist**

- [ ] Run `flutter clean`
- [ ] Run `flutter pub get`
- [ ] Build new APK with `flutter build apk --debug`
- [ ] Install APK with `flutter install`
- [ ] Test sync functionality
- [ ] Verify green success message appears

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

The error occurs because:
1. Assets were added to the project
2. But the APK was built BEFORE the assets were properly configured
3. So the old APK doesn't contain the credentials file
4. The service tries to load from file system (which doesn't exist on mobile)
5. Falls back to the error message

**The fix is simply rebuilding the APK after proper asset configuration.**

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If the problem persists after following these steps:

1. **Check if you're running the OLD APK** - Make sure you installed the new one
2. **Verify assets are in the APK** - Use Android Studio to inspect the built APK
3. **Check console logs** - Look for "✅ Credentials loaded from assets successfully"
4. **Test on different device** - Rule out device-specific issues

The fix is working correctly - you just need to ensure you're running the properly built APK with assets included.
